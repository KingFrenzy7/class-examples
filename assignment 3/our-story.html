        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>BCP had a long past in the goth/metal scene but after the tragic loss
            of their keyboard player to drugs one night on tour, we broke up.
            The lead singer shortly found God while looking for meaning and shared
            Him with the rest of the remaining band members one at a time. We all
            came to know God in the midst of their greatest pain. Now, knowing and
            grieving the final destination of their friend, We've decided to reform the band.
            We created a new album: "Expelle Noctem" which is latin for "banish the night".
            We don't want to lose a single fan to this fate and while we still have a following,
            We're going to make one more tour to try to save as many fans as we can.
        <blockquote>Out of pain, hope. Out of grief, purpose. Out of love, service.</blockquote>
